# Self Hosted Instances

With a bit of work, it's possible to deploy the KnowWhereGraph stack on your own machine.

## Should You Do This?

Chances are, **you don't want to do this**. Chances are, you want the data in your own graph database. If that's the case,

1. Choose a graph database that supports RDF and GeoSPARQL
2. Obtain KnowWhereGraph's RDF data dump (**Not currently possible**)
3. Obtain KnowWhereGraph's ontology files (**Not currently possible**)
4. Load the data+ontology into your graph database (make sure you have an RDFS reasoner running)

**If you really want the entire stack**

1. You will be running the various webapps:
   1. Knowledge Explorer
   2. Node Explorer
   3. kw-panels
2. You'll have the kwg-api
3. You'll have prometheus+grafana
4. You'll have nginx running as a reverse proxy

Doing the above is most likely more than you need, and can be complicated to deploy. If you'd still like to, read on.

## Prerequisites

1. Compute resources (requirements are listed in the deployment repository)
2. Raw triplified data (data in the form of .ttl, .trig, etc). **We do not provide this and it cannot be generated by you**
3. Fortitude and willpower to deploy the stack

## Deployment

1. Clone the [deployment repository](https://github.com/KnowWhereGraph/kwg-deployment)
2. Attempt a deployment on localhost before configuring things to your own domain
   1. Follow the instructions in the repository for the localhost deployment
   2. Only load a subset of data to conserve compute resources
   3. Confirm that graphdb is running, accessible, and has the data you loaded
3. If you got the stack deployed to localhost, you're now ready to configure the stack for your own hostname
4. Search for all the references to stko-kwg.geog.ucsb.edu (our production address) and replace with your hostname
5. Follow the instructions for deploying to production
