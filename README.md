A guide to using KnowWhereGraph

## Understanding the Ontology

Before you can use KnowWhereGraph's data, you must first understand parts of the ontology that are relevant to you. How do you find which parts are relevant to you? Get a crash course in the most important ontology aspects and obtain a bird's eye view to figure out what to ask for, and how &mdash; [Here](./ontology.md).

## Data Acquisition

Obtaining data can be a difficult process &mdash; if you're using SPAQRL (which you will be), it's even more so. Learn a few tips and tricks for getting the data you need from the database [Here](./sparql-download.md).

## Running Your Own

It's possible to run your own instance of KnowWhereGraph! Do you *need* to? Do you want to? Read on [Here](./self-hosted.md) to make that call.
