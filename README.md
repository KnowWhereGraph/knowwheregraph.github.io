## Understanding the Ontology

Before you can use KnowWhereGraph's data, you must first understand part of the ontology that are relevant to you. How do you find which parts of the ontology are relevant to you? Get a crash course into the most important ontology aspects and to obtain a bird's eye view to figure out what to ask for, and how - [Here](./ontology.md).

## Data Acquisition

## Running your own

It's possible to run your own instance of KnowWhereGraph! Do you *need* to? Do you want to? Read on [Here](./self-hosted.md) to make that call.
